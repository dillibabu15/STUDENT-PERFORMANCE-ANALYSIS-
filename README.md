# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance using academic scores in **math**, **reading**, and **writing**, along with demographic attributes. It aims to understand how factors such as **parental education** influence academic outcomes and identifies patterns using data analytics and clustering.

## 📝 Abstract

**Student Performance Analysis** focuses on evaluating student outcomes using a dataset that includes demographics and academic scores in mathematics, reading, and writing. The main objectives include:

- Analyzing the distribution of individual subject scores  
- Determining **pass/fail status**  
- Examining the **influence of parental education levels** on student performance  

The study uses **descriptive statistics**, **data visualizations**, and **K-Means clustering** to identify patterns and categorize students. Grades are assigned based on percentage thresholds to assess overall academic standing.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- Students with highly educated parents tend to score higher  
- K-Means clustering reveals clear performance groups  
- Grade distribution provides a basis for **targeted educational strategies**
